**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I was most interested in adversarial robustness in large language models. It showed how small prompt changes can drastically affect model behavior and reliability.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
One idea is to study how different prompt-defense methods reduce harmful outputs in fine-tuned LLMs. I’d compare their effectiveness using quantitative safety metrics.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would add more structured evaluation metrics instead of relying on qualitative observations. This would make the project’s results easier to compare and replicate.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’d like to try explainability tools like SHAP to visualize what drives model decisions. I’m also interested in testing lightweight adversarial fine-tuning strategies.
